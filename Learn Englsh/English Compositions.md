## Youngsters' Worship
1. college students now excessively admire big stars
2. analyze the reasons for this phenomenon
3. my opinion
```
Nowadays, star-worshiping is popular among teenagers, especially many university students.

Why? When it comes to the symptoms of worshiping a star, the main factor I’d like to mention is imitation. With a blind love for their idols, teenagers firmly believe that their choices are the best. As a result, the stars’ clothes, hairstyles and hobbies, as well as their behaviors in public, are closely observed or followed, though, to some extent, they may be considered improper or even ridiculous.

In my opinion, having idols is not a bad thing. However, we should make it clear who are the real “heroes”. As far as I am concerned, the real heroes are those who are making the most contributions to our society, such as teachers, doctors and scientists. As students, we should learn from them. Only in this way can we become useful persons in the future.

## The Internet
1. Some people think that the Internet can make study and work more efficient
2. Some people, however, think that the Internet makes teenagers addicted and interferes with their studies
3. My opinion
```
In the era of information and technology, the Internet plays an important role in our 

society. However, people’s opinions are still divided on this point. Those who are in favor of the Internet claim that it has a lot of advantages. Firstly, information searching is no longer a tough job with the help of all kinds of search engines. Secondly, we can contact friends or business partners via e-mails or software such as Internet Meeting and Yahoo Messenger.

Those who are opposed to the Internet hold that its disadvantages are numerous. In the first place, using the Internet costs considerable time, money and energy, especially for those with poor self-control. In the second place, increasing young people are indulged in online games and unhealthy information, which are extremely harmful to their development.

In my opinion, its pros outweigh the cons. The past twenty years have witnessed the fast development of the Internet along with the national economy. A brighter future is awaiting us if we make good use of the Internet.

## Free Admission to Parks
1. more and more parks are opening for free, what is the purpose
2. it also brings some problems
3. your opinion
```
To encourage people to go outside and relax, a mounting number of parks offer free admission now. People benefit from it, especially during these tough economic times. With free entry, more people will have the opportunity for affordable vacations for families, taking pleasure in the natural landscape.

Fresh air and landscapes in parks are good for people. However, too many people

flocking into parks might not be so good for the parks.

For example, some visitors leave their garbage behind, which may cause environmental pollution. And people’s barbeques and stamping will also bring damage to the grassland and other greeneries in parks.

As a university student, I’m in favor of free admission to parks. Free entry to parks not only saves people’s expenditure, but also makes things fairer — people like the poor and students can go to parks frequently as well. On the other hand, visitors should be informed to preserve the environment while enjoying the beauty of the nature.

## Green Consumption
1. the concept of green consumption is becoming increasingly popular in China
2. there are still many difficulties in promoting green consumption in China
3. how to solve this problem
```
The conception of green consumption has gradually become popular in China. More and more green foods are making their appearance on the market and more and more

people are becoming conscious of environmental protection.

However, there still exist quite a few difficulties in the further promotion of green consumption. On the one hand, many people are still not quite clear of the advantages of green foods. On the other hand, due to high profits, many fake green foods are found in the

market. Moreover, many consumers don’t want to pay extra money for green foods.

There may be several ways to solve these problems. Firstly, the government should supervise the good quality strictly to protect consumers’ interests. Secondly, the conception of green consumption should be further promoted and emphasized. Thirdly, the government should work together with manufacturers to make the price more reasonable.

## Creating a Harmonious Campus
1. It is important to build a harmonious campus
2. Harmonious campus is not only about harmonious environment
3. To build a harmonious campus we should ......
```
A harmonious campus is of vital importance. It is just like a solid, colorful and appealing textbook. It nurtures the students’ mentality, beautifies their minds, sparks their aspirations, enlightens their wisdom and accelerates their overall development.

When it comes to a harmonious campus, we do not merely mean a beautiful environment on campus. We also mean a healthy interpersonal relationship, where teachers and students get along well, while students respect and care for each other. We mean a sustainable campus that brings teachers and students to fully play their enthusiasm and positivism as well, while at the same time reinforce campus regulations and campus order.

The creation of a harmonious campus needs joint efforts of institutes and students. Colleges and universities should introduce advanced campus culture which encourages a variety of creative extra-curricular activities and puts first staff, faculty and students. As students, we should behave ourselves, learn to be tolerant and respect each other.

## Due Attention Should Be Given to Speaking
1. Many students today do not pay attention to speaking in English learning
2. The reasons for this phenomenon are ......
3. To change this situation, I think ......
```
Nowadays fewer and fewer students pay attention to their spoken English, which results in a dramatic increase in the number of students who can spell English words but are incapable of speaking them fluently or correctly. This phenomenon has aroused many people’s attention.

Why does such a phenomenon emerge? As far as I’m concerned, there are possibly two reasons contributing to this phenomenon. On the one hand, exam-oriented education makes many schools lay emphasis on passing the English exams, which leads to the lack of speaking environment for students to practice their spoken English. On the other hand, students themselves don’t realize the importance of the ability to speak English which has a great influence on their future 

study and career development.

To change this situation, I think, we can take the following measures. First, the importance of oral English should be emphasized to raise students’ awareness of the necessity of speaking English. Second, exams should be modified to make students pay attention to their spoken English. Third, schools can organize various activities to arouse students’ interest in speaking English.

## Parents’ Being Slaves to Children
1. some parents have become "child slaves" nowadays
2. the reasons for this phenomenon
3. the possible effects of this phenomenon
```
Parents’ being slaves to their children or “child’s slave” is nowadays a hot topic in China. It refers to young parents who have to spend a large part of their income on children. These parents feel great strain under the burden of raising a child and struggle hard to make as much money as possible.

The cost of raising a child in China is becoming greater and greater. But economic pressure is not the only reason that makes young parents “child’s slave”. Parents’ competing with each other in trying to provide the best possible living conditions for their children should also be blamed. 

If this problem continues, it would affect parents and the development of our country. These parents would suffer from huge economic pressure, which may pose a threat to their marriages or physical and mental health. On the other hand, to avoid being slaves, some couples are unwilling to have children.

## Shopping through Media
1. many people now shop through the media
2. there are advantages and disadvantages of media shopping
3. my opinion
```
With the development of science and technology, it is much more common for people to buy goods through different kinds of media than before. People can buy things such as computers and necklaces through TV, radio, the Internet, etc.

Shopping through media is welcomed by most people due to various reasons. From the perspective of consumers, it can save time for people who don’t have much spare time. For retailers, it can cut costs for those without much circulating funds. However, there are still some defects in shopping through media. First, compared with face-to-face deal, it seems less reliable and trustworthy. Second, people will lose the fun of bargaining.

In my view, although shopping via media brings great convenience to us, we still should be brings great convenience to us, we still should be careful when we “go shopping” through media. We should check the information released by the media. Only in this way can we fully enjoy the convenience brought by media shopping without the concern of being cheated.

## Goal Setting Is Important
Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a short essay entitled Goal Setting Is Important by commenting on John Ruskin’s famous remark, “Living without an aim is like sailing without a compass.” You should write at least 120 words but no more than 180 words.
```
“Living without an aim is like sailing without a compass.” This philosophical wisdom by John Ruskin, one of the greatest British writers, tells us that goal setting is extremely important in life.

Why is goal setting so important? The main importance of goal setting is that it provides us with direction and purpose. When we have goals, we know what we want to achieve so that we can focus our mindson a single worthwhile target and avoid getting distracted easily. Personal goal setting also provides us with motivation to achieve what we want to achieve.

Goal setting is of especial significance for today’s students. A study reveals that when students set goals, they learn the importance of taking responsibility, of minimizing excuses and of helping others. Goal setting is a lifelong skill that first helps students succeed in school and then later in life.

## On Cosmetic Surgeries
1. In recent years, plastic surgery has become a common phenomenon
2. the reasons for this phenomenon
3. my views and suggestions on this phenomenon
```
In recent years, there have appeared more and more artificial beauties around us. Not only those actresses but also many ordinary women are crazy about cosmetic surgeries. They fail to resist the temptation of becoming more beautiful by changing some parts of their bodies within a few hours’ surgery. 

What are responsible for the prevalence of cosmetic surgeries? Firstly, thanks to the development of shaping techniques, the chances of successful surgeries have increased greatly, which makes more people begin to believe and accept cosmetic surgeries. Secondly, with the improvement of living standard, people have more money to satisfy their nature of pursuing beauty.

From my point of view, cosmetic surgeries have their necessity of existence in modern society. They do help some people build confidence by giving them a beautiful face or figure. However, cosmetic surgeries cannot bring permanent beauty and might be dangerous. Besides, I think one’s inner beauty is more important. Therefore, I suggest that people should think twice before deciding to accept cosmetic surgeries.

## More People Choosing Overseas Destinations for Their Holidays
Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a short essay entitled More People Choosing Overseas Destinations for Their Holidays based on the statistics provided in the chart below. Please give a brief description of the chart first and then make comments on it. You should write at least 120 words but no more than 180 words.
```
More People Choosing Overseas Destinations for Their Holidays

From the chart given above, we can observe that the number of people traveling abroad experienced some changes during the past several years. From 1993 to 2003, the number of Chinese people choosing overseas destinations for their holidays increased rapidly from less than 5 million to 20 million, and then to 70 million in 2011.

What exactly contribute to this phenomenon? Reasons can be listed as follows: for one thing, the authorities have issued some preferential policies to promote the development of the overseas tourism industry, which encourages a sudden emergence of travel agencies that can provide customers with convenient overseas tourism services. For another, with the improvement of financial status and purchasing power, a considerable number of Chinese people can afford the once-deemed-expensive traveling expenses.

By observing the past trends, we may forecast that the growth tendency will continue. However, it is also a highly variable industry which is vulnerable to seasons and climates, international political situation, fluctuations in exchange.

## Teenagers' Studying Abroad
1. there are many teenagers studying abroad nowadays
2. some people think this practice is beneficial
3. I think
```
Recently it seems that among the students who choose to study abroad, there are more and more-teenagers who study in high schools or even elementary schools. Many people, especially the parents, think it will certainly do good to their chidren because the independent life will make them learn confidence and perseverance. Moreover, the quality of overseas education is often higher, thus the child stands a better chance of entering a better university and getting a better job in the future. 

After careful consideration, I have to say the above view is more than biased. On the one hand, early independent life is not necessarily good, if the child cannot receive proper guidance and tender care from both teachers and parents. On the other hand, the educational quality is also a question—too many foreign schools aim at earning money. When the children come back, who can guarantee that they can adapt to the fierce competition here?

We can see clearly that although teenagers' studying abroad may bring favorable results, there are still a lot to worry about. It seems necessary for young students to make a careful investigation before going abroad.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Electronic Dictionary
1. Advantages of electronic dictionaries
2. the disadvantages of electronic dictionaries
3. my conclusion
```
The discussion about electronic dictionaries has never stopped in the past few years. Let's have a look at its advantages and disadvantages before drawing the final conclusion.

The biggest advantage of an electronic dictionary is its convenience. Whenever you meet new words or expressions, you can know the meaning quickly. What's more, with the development of science and technology, electronic dictionaries are becoming more and more advanced: they can pronounce the words clearly, provide sample sentences to illustrate word usage and store difficult words for special memorization. Last but by no means the least, electronic dictionaries are becoming cheaper and cheaper, and more and more students can afford them.

However, the negative effects are also obvious. To begin with, some students rely too much on the electronic dictionary—they never put their heart into learning new words and expressions. In the second place, some explanations are neither complete nor accurate, which are quite misleading. Finally, new technical inventions do not necessarily lead to progress in learning. Diligence is always the decisive factor, because "there is no royal road to learning".

Up until now, we can see it clearly that an electronic dictionary is not beneficial or harmful in itself. The key lies in the user—so long as we can make proper use of it, it can be most helpful to us in many respects.

## Opening Psychological Courses
1. many people suggest that universities offer psychology courses
2. my opinion on this issue
```
Recently more and more educator and common citizens suggest that universities colleges open more courses which are helpful for students' psychological health. Personally, I fully agree with their proposal for the following reasons.

On the one hand, the ever-increasing pressure of study at the moment and job-hunting in the future may lead to many psychological problems such as anxiety, depression and even despair, and the psychological courses open a door for communication and relaxation. On the other hand, such courses can teach students how to regulate feelings and emotions under different situations, which is a good preparation for the future life in the complex social network. Finally, these courses also introduce good habits which are conducive to mental and psychological health. To be mature and qualified citizens in the society, students have to do more than study hard.

In a word, I warmly welcome the establishment of psychological courses in universities. In my mind, they are good for students' psychological development.

## My View on Double BA Degree
1. it is common for college students to study double degrees nowadays
2. my opinion on this phenomenon
```
Recently it has become a common phenomenon for college students to have two majors at the same time. In this way, they can get double BA degrees when they graduate from the university several years later.

Although it may bring unfavorable consequences, we can be sure to conclude that this practice is favorable on the whole. To begin with, most students will become more hardworking and efficient in order to finish the learning tasks satisfactorily. Moreover, with two degrees at hand after graduation, they will stand a better chance in the job market full of fierce competition. In the third place, as for today's university students, tuition and fees are becoming more and more expensive. If they can make achievements in study at school and find a satisfactory job afterwards, it will not be a big problem.

Weighing the pros and cons of such a new trend, we can naturally arrive at the conclusion that it is beneficial and rewarding. This system not only compels students to work hard, but also prepares them for the coming competition.
