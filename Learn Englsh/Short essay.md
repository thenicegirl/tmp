## How to Deal with Pressure in Campus
```
Facing others’ hard work and good performance in academic and other aspects, many students feel more threatened by pressure than ever before.
 
Then, how to deal with pressure in college life? The following measures can be taken. First, you should take a careful look at your present level and set a practical object. You needn’t always compare yourselves with those on the top and just make your efforts towards your object. Second, under peer pressure, you shouldn’t feel discouraged and pressed. Instead, you should make it your motivation for harder work. Finally, if you find pressure is nearly beyond your control, you’d better turn to professional psychological guidance.
 
As a college student, I have no way to avoid pressure, so I set my own goal, including my practical level and my position among the peers. Because of my focus on my own goal, I have no time and energy to think about the pressure. So I’m little troubled by it. To conclude, we should not escape from pressure, but learn to make best use of it, since it can hardly be avoided.

## The Craze of Trainings among College Students
```
A recent survey indicates that an increasingly large number of students in our college attend various trainings enthusiastically. And there has been a heated argument about whether the students should attend them or not.    
 
Different people hold different views. Many people attended various training willingly for the sake of a high mark on the academic records or getting different certificates. Some other people stand on a different ground. For one thing, the aim of training is to help people pass all kinds of examinations and it mainly focuses on the teaching examination skills, but not to train people to think creatively and even restrict their efforts in getting command of the knowledge. For another, people spend so much time participating n various training that they cannot find enough time for their own work. Moreover, the tuition fee of the training is usually high, thus laying great financial burden on people.

From my point of view, attending trainings will do people no good, and it is time-consuming as well as costly.

Dear Lucy,

I am delighted to learn that you will graduate from university next year. It has been a pleasant surprise to hear from you again after such a long time.

In my opinion, to find a job after graduation is the best choice for you. On the one hand, you can put what you have learned into practice. On the other hand, you can make a living on your own instead of depending heavily on your parents.

As to which job to take, I suggest that you choose one that allows you to bring your knowledge and ability into full play. If you have much spare time after work, you can study by yourself and keep on improving your skills. It is unnecessary for you to work overtime. In addition, you can take the postgraduate entrance examination some years later if you want to. I am sure you will have a bright future.

Please inform me when you have come to a decision. I am looking forward to your reply. 

	Sincerely yours,
	Huck
